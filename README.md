De or het?
One of the harderst things for Dutch language learners to get a grip on, is the article of a noun. 
Dutch makes use of two definite articles: 'de' (masculine and femenine) and 
'het' (neuter) of which 'de' is the most common.
To a learner it may seem arbitrary when to use which (it certainly feels that way even to
native Dutch speakers), however, there are a few rules that determine when to use 
which article.

These rules include, but are not limited to:
* for 'de':
	- the plural form;
	- numbers and ordinals ('de een, de eerste')
	- rivers ('de Maas')
	- fruit & vegetables ('de appel', 'de broccoli')

* for 'het':
	- diminutives (singular form only)
	- games & sports ('het basketbal')
	- colors ('het blauw van je ogen')
	- languages ('het spaans', 'het nederlands')
	- metals
